# CustomerSegmentation

##Introduction

This project aims to study spending behaviour of customers based on their credit card information. This is done by segmenting all customers into four major categories, namely:
1. Alienated: LOW BALANCE, LOW PURCHASE
2. Roamers: MEDIUM TO HIGH BALANCE, LOW PURCHASE
3. Supporters: LOW BALANCE, HIGH PURCHASE
4. Fans: HIGH PURCHASE

These customer segments aide us in executing different market strategy for different individuals, which ultimately lines up with every firm's aim of increasing customer satisfaction and brand loyality.
